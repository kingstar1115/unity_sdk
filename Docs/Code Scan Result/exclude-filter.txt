# This file defines an unordered collection of files to exclude from CSAR scanning.
# (Note that an excluded file can be a regular file -- text of binary --  or a directory.
# If a directory is excluded, all files and directories that it contains are excluded from scanning.)
# Note that scanned files may be logically excluded from the scan at analysis time in the CSAR analyzer UI.
# Any files excluded by this filter will not be able to be included back into the analysis by the CSAR analyzer UI.
#
# This list is applied to all code sets, e.g. to both Base and Delta code sets in a Diff scan.
# Exclusion filters take precedence over legal filters as defined by legal-filter.txt.
# That is, files excluded from the scan by this filter will never be marked as legal files.
#
# This filter is bundled with a CSAR jar, and will be used by default unless the user creates..
#       PROJECT_HOME\exclude-filter.txt
#   ..where PROJECT_HOME is the root directory of CSAR-generated project artifacts.
# -- OR --
#       CSAR_HOME\exclude-filter.txt
#   ..where CSAR_HOME is the root directory where CSAR is installed.
# Any user-defined exclusion file list entirely replaces the list in the CSAR jar.
#
# The CSAR scanner uses this search order to find exclude-filter.txt (and all other custom filters):
#   1. PROJECT_HOME
#   2. CSAR_HOME
#   3. CSAR_HOME/lib/csar-scanner-nnn.jar.
#
# IMPORTANT: For the project, this exclude-filter is used until you either delete, rename, or replace PROJECT_HOME\exclude-filter.txt.
#
#            For CSAR_HOME, this exclude-filter is used for all scans, unless overridden by PROJECT_HOME\exclude-filter.txt.
#
# The following patterns define full path names to be excluded as specified in Java regular expression syntax.
# In patterns, / represents the path/directory separator, even in Windows.
# NOTE: For Windows scans, the path separator must be changed from \ to / in this exclude-filter.txt file.
# All patterns are compiled as case insensitive.
# Specify only a single pattern per uncommented line.
# \ escapes special characters in the regular expression

# - Java regular expression reference/definition: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
# The code uses http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html matches method
# trying to match the file's absolute path name against each pattern.
# http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/File.html#getAbsolutePath()
# Each pattern you specify must match a full path name
# Test your Java "case insensitive" regex pattern in the CSAR analyzer UI from Help->Test RegEx.

# Unlike other filters, the patterns in this filter match the full canonical pathname.
# / is the path separator, even on Windows.
# A directory should *NOT* end in /, as the pattern will not match.

# Exclude library control files for SVN
# .svn is a directory containing SVN control files
# These files are used by SVN, a source code control system, and are not shipped, nor included in builds.
# Excludes foo/.svn, Foo/bar/.Svn, /.svn
# Does NOT exclude asvn, foo/Bsvn, foo.svn, .svns, foo/bar.svn, foo/bar/.svns, foo/.svns
# Note that foo/.svn/bar would be excluded, not because the pattern matches,
# but since the directory foo/.svn would be excluded, so would all files in and beneath it, including foo/.svn/bar
.*/\.svn

# Exclude library control files for CVS
# CVS is a directory containing CVS control files
# .cvsignore tells CVS what files to ignore, using patterns.
# These files are used by CVS, a source code control system, and are not shipped, nor included in builds.
# ignore git source files as well

# Exclude library control files for Jazz RTC
# .jazzignore tells Jazz RTC what files to ignore, using patterns.
# These files are used by Jazz RTC, a source code control system, and are not shipped, nor included in builds.
# combined with .cvsignore above.
#.*/\.jazzignore

# Exclude library control files for Rational Clear Case.
# .COPYAREA.DAT is used to detect changes.
# .COPYAREA.DB contains a list of files that are loaded in the view as well as metadata about the files.
# See https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21119280.
# These files are used by Jazz RTC, a source code control system, and are not shipped, nor included in builds.

# Exclude file created by Mac OS X to store custom folder attributes
# These files are not shipped, nor included in builds.

# ----------------------------- Full Path Excludes ----------------------------
# Exclude a file or directory by full path.
# / is the path separator, even on Windows, so for Windows scans, the path separator must be changed from ' \ ' to ' / ' in this exclude-filter.txt file.
# A directory should *NOT* end in /, as the pattern will not match.
# In the following example, "testFile" can be a file or directory.
# On windows (note the lead . matches the drive letter.  You could use c as well):
# c:/foo/bar/testFile
# .:/foo/bar/testFile
# On Unix variants:
# /foo/bar/testFile
