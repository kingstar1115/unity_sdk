The film series corresponds with the book translation.","id":"WK_237148","title":"Harry Potter in translation","document":"http://9.53.163.75:9080/WatsonApp/deepqa/v1/question/document/WK_237148/41853/42264","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"timestamp":"2013-07-01T00:52:11Z","originalfile":"/apps/preproc/r2.9.0/20140403-2100/intermediate/wp-20130708/xml-splitTrecTrim_chunks_73/enwiki.8.xml","title":"Harry Potter in translation","corpusName":"Wikipedia","preprocessdate":"2014-04-05T05:59:22Z","deepqaid":"220598584","fileName":"/apps/preproc/r2.9.0/20140403-2100/intermediate/wp-20130708/xml-splitTrecTrimDetag/enwiki.8.xml","provider":"Wikipedia","DOCNO":"237148","publisher":"Wikipedia"}},{"value":"0.0541091271103556","text":"which means \"Lord Voldemort\".
