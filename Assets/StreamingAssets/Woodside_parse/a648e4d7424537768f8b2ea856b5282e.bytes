A screening/case mapping study was completed to determine sand control techniques that may be feasible for the various GWF-2 fields. This review of production analogues against available core data demonstrated that compatible sand control types included Expandable Sand Screens (ESS) or gravel packing techniques (open or cased hole). Final selection of sand control type was then refined based on the key drivers listed below: Required level of operational robustness. With the NWS venture moving into an offshore (well) capacity constrained phase of production there will be increased demands to apply higher drawdown levels and more rapid bean up schedules on the available wells, emphasising the requirement for robust sand control designs. This may be further compounded by production via a single common riser with GWF-1: more onerous and/or unpredictable production conditions may be imposed on the GWF-2 wells. Single well developments (e.g. Sculptor and Rankin wells are the only drainage points in the fault block) imply more significant consequences (loss of reserves) in the event of a lower completion failure. This compares to multi-well developments which bring a higher degree of production redundancy and may be more suited a less conservative design philosophy. Quality of core data. High quality (i.e. in field) core provides higher confidence levels and enables more aggressive sand control design philosophy. Where design bases rely on core acquired from more distant analogues a more conservative design approach is required. Design well life. Gravel pack completions (long track record) traditionally provide a greater longevity than ESS completions, the data set for which is much more limited due to the relative newness of this technology. Cost. There is an incremental cost increase of US$2.5-5.0M per well to install OHGP (Open Hole Gravel Pack) lower completion rather than the cheaper ESS (Expandable Sand Screens) option. Unwanted fluids production. Water or oil production will impose more onerous conditions for sand control, driving the decision towards gravel packing techniques (in preference to ESS). Using this assessment methodology, gravel packing techniques have been selected for all GWF-2 fields [Ref 11]. Lady Nora-Pemberton, Sculptor-Rankin and Dockrell wells will all employ OHGP completions, where single zone well designs are most suited to this technique. Alternate path technology (i.e. shunt tube screens) is recommended to maximise the chances of achieving a complete gravel pack. The Keast well requires a multi-zone intelligent completion, which demands a cased hole solution to provide the necessary zonal isolation. A cased hole gravel pack technique is therefore required: high rate water pack (HRWP), extension pack (limited fracturing) or Frac & Pack (F&P) will all be considered for further evaluation in detailed design.","id":"T_989F19E3AD7FDB8639DC04187830BB60","title":"PM #9278730 v8 NWS GWF 2 Well Concept Select Report : 3 Drilling and Completions : 3.3 Conceptual Completion Design : 3.3.1 Sand Control Selection and Lower Completion Design:","document":"http://10.118.84.17:8080/instance/mel002/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_989F19E3AD7FDB8639DC04187830BB60/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"corpusName":"PB","drimsNumber":"9278730","referenceDrimsNumber":"9278730","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_989F19E3AD7FDB86DBC02C2B308E82F7","version":"8","originalfile":"PM-#9278730-v8-NWS GWF-2 Well Concept Select Report.doc","author":"wopny8","title":"PM #9278730 v8 NWS GWF 2 Well Concept Select Report : 3 Drilling and Completions : 3.3 Conceptual Completion Design : 3.3.1 Sand Control Selection and Lower Completion Design:","fileName":"PM-#9278730-v8-NWS_GWF-2_Well_Concept_Select_Report.doc","year":"2014","DOCNO":"989F19E3AD7FDB86DBC02C2B308E82F7","projectName":"Goodwyn,GWF2,NWS","canonical":"GWF2"}},{"value":"0.04239771515130997","text":"No PSD data from the Sculptor or Rankin fields exists (no core available).
