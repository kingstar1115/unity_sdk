{"question":{"qclasslist":[{"value":"FACTOID"},{"value":"DESCRIPTIVE"}],"focuslist":[{"value":"what"}],"latlist":[{"value":"failure mode"},{"value":"mode"}],"evidencelist":[{"value":"1.0","text":" The following table documents the key discussions held with BP and Halliburton and the learnings that can be applied to GWF-1. The points listed 'For Info' are learnings that are intended to increase the understanding of the technology and its application to all teams involved with the SMART Well completions from testing and installation through to operation. Phase. Topic. Observation. Recommendation for GWF-1. Design Considerations. ICV Design Life. The HS-ICVs are qualified for 480 open-close cycles [3]. Beyond 480 cycles, some wear may occur on the metal-to-metal seal that could result in communication between wellbore and reservoir, which is expected to be insignificant. Wear can also occur on the hydraulic static seals, increasing the risk of hydrocarbon ingress into control lines. FMECA and FTA analysis on the ICV has been performed which show low likelihood of failure for the various set of possible failures due to ICV design, material selection and testing. DRIMS#8148987. The risk of exceeding the qualified no. of ICV cycles should be considered when determining the cross-flow management philosophy. Include a counter in PCS for each ICV to capture valve actuation cycle frequency. Get vendor documentation which describe operating envelope, operating guidelines and troubleshooting methods for future operation. ICV Pressure Differential. Each HS-ICV is rated for a differential pressure of 5,000psi (2000 psi for injection applications) [3]. The greatest risk of erosion is when the ICV moves from position 2 to position 3 - when the first 'hole' is revealed. The ICV is still 'closed' at position 1 and 2 however the metal-to-metal seal is broken enabling pressure communication between the tubing and reservoir. This reduces the severity of the initial pressure event that occurs at position 3. CFD analysis has been performed to determine erosion rates based on different scenarios and results indicate negligible cumulative erosion throughout design life. [ref. DRIMS#8131838]. Include ICV general operation description on the operating procedure (Process Description Level). Include ICV max DP in the Well integrity Envelope. ICV Reliability. Of the 34 SMART Wells operated by BP, only four instances of ICV failure have occurred. All four were on the Atlantis field which utilises Baker Hughes ICVs. The failure mode was observed on start-up, where the sleeves did not respond to hydraulic control. Note that function testing from the installation rig was satisfactory. It was also highlighted that Na Kika F3 well lower ICV [ON/OFF] didn't close during commissioning phase, which subsequently rectified. One of the zones then starts producing sand and isolated, with ICV left closed for more than 5 years. There is no plan maintenance in place for ICV (ie. periodic ICV actuation after being in the same position for certain amount of time) although BP acknowledge there is potential to have a seize ICV due to scaling. Some ICVs have remained in the fully open position for up to 5 years. Halliburton recommends that ICVs are cycled at least once every three months. WEL to consider benefit of periodically actuating the ICV to avoid valve seizing. The maintenance plan should consider ICV actuation during any well test and shut-in. Downhole Pressure and Temperature Gauge Reliability. Over 1000 ROCTM permanent monitoring systems have been installed of which over 500 are in subsea applications. Reliability as of 2011 is >95% [3]. FMECA and FTA analysis on ROC gauge has been carried out by the Woodside D&C team, which show low likelihood of failure for the various set of possible failures due to gauge design, material selection and testing. DRIMS#8537307. Compound Movements. Halliburton has integrated the functionality to perform compound movements, however does not recommend them due to the risk of under stroking (and thus erosion). BP has utilised compound movements before in its operations. Note that consequential erosion might only be realised towards the end of design life or when the completion is pulled. Compound movement for the ICV is part of GWF-1 subsea control EFAT (logic testing) and Production SIT (hydraulic response). GWF-1 initially estimated ~5 minutes per ICV movement. Restarting a well particularly time consuming, and thus compound movements provided a significant benefit. Testing indicates the hydraulic response time may now be significantly less. Confirm hydraulic response time during SITs to reassess the risk-benefit trade-off for compound movements. HMI Graphics. The Na Kika HMI graphics are similar to those established for GWF-1. Additional features observed included: Pressure differential between zone-tubing and zone-zone. Hydraulic LP supply, function and return lines are clearly shown through a 3-way valve (DCV), which provide operator with graphical information on pressurisation and venting sequence. (ABB system has very limited capability on the PPB HMI to incorporate similar display) Countdown displays of the time remaining for each ICV to complete an open (supply and vent) and close command. This display helps the operator to recall how long each action will take. The Na Kika HMI graphics do not show: Pressure differential across the ICV. Note that GWF-1 have dual DHPT gauges (both annulus and tubing pressure) and therefore have the functionality to monitor ICV dP. Consider adding timer displays for the open-supply, open-vent and close actions on each ICV. Consider adding new tags to display differential pressure across each ICV to assist CRO to monitor max allowable DP. Installation & Commissioning. System Integration Testing. The ICV hydraulic response (open, venting and closing duration) will be recorded during SIT. DCV pulse, hold and wait time will be set to allow sufficient time above the recorded hydraulic response time to ensure complete valve movement. Ensure verification of the ICV position especially on compound movement during SIT. ICV Function Testing. Typically, the ICVs undergo function testing at the SIT (onshore), immediately prior to being installed (offshore) and during subsea control cold commissioning (prior to introduction of hydrocarbons). Fluid Cleanliness. The Accu-Pulse design utilises micro-hydraulics and therefore fluid cleanliness during installation / commissioning is imperative. During installation, there is potential for well completion fluid to enter the control lines through the national coupler poppet on top of the tubing hanger. It is recommended to pressurize the line prior to removing the THRT to avoid ingress. Note: it is essentially the same batch of fluid moving backwards and forwards through the Accu-Pulse since the volume of the piston is insignificant compared to the total volume of the line. BP completion engineers recommend the installation of a hydraulic line filter before the Acu-Pulse to capture any debris or particles that fall downhole into the hydraulic line and could potentially block the Acu-pulse. WEL risk review (ref. DRIMS#7787972) has concluded that the use of stand-alone downhole filters is generally not recommended in subsea wells due to the additional leak path and possibility of the filter media plugging. Mitigation measures primarily through procedures by ensuring the correct level of fluid cleanliness. Ensure installation procedures capture the requirement to achieve the correct fluid cleanliness level and close supervision during termination. Consider increasing the control line pressure prior to THRT removal when installing the ICV to avoid completion fluid ingress into control line. Start-Up. Well Bean Up. ICV's are either fully open or fully closed during well clean-up of each zone, with flowrate controlled by the subsea choke valve. This is the same philosophy adopted for GWF-1. Well Clean Up. During the start up of the Galapgos field (three wells with 1, 1 and 2 zones respectively) it took approximately 3-4 days to clean up each zone. The respective ICVs were fully open during clean up, and the lowest zone (if applicable) was cleaned up first. The campaign to clean up and reach steady state for the three wells (4 zones) took twenty days. Operation. Well Bean Up. ICVs are moved to their desired operating position before opening the tree choke valve. General guideline on ICV actuation time (5min/10,000ft + 1 min for valve movement). Vendor recommendation. 5 minute pressurisation to open. 12 minute to vent. 5 min pressurisation to close. Note: operator experience is that each ICV will not take more than 20 minutes to step through from the fully closed to the fully open position. In field response time typically shorter due to hydrostatic affect inside the well and water depth. (Test typically done on horizontal plane and ambient condition). There is a potential issue to determine ICV actual position without the position sensor module. Possible solution is to reset the valve position at fully close position. Vendor recommends plotting flow (valve Cv) against valve steps as guides for operator to monitor the ICV position. Note that the plots could be affected by erosion and adjusted accordingly. Consider configurations where the choke can be opened before all ICVs are fully open if SIT shows significantly longer opening and venting times. Consider plotting ICV Cv vs. Steps as a guide for operator to determine the ICV correct position, with reset capability when the valve is closed. Normal Operation. The Na Kika facility does not adjust the position of their ICVs on a regular basis. Most of the well test (multi-rate and PBU) were done during early life or when requested by the BU for production allocation and optimisation. In the case of the Na Kika Field, the need to close the ICV later in field production life has been reduced as sufficient reservoir information has already been collected. Some Na Kika zones are shut-in due to unwanted water production. Otherwise their zones are operated fully open. Operator relies on PDHG reading and subsea meter (MPFM) to confirm flow from each zones. Consideration should be given for the GWF well to remove the need to close ICV during shutdowns later in field life. The need for closure of ICV's during shutdowns should be assessed when differential pressure between zones becomes significant and/or when oil or water is produced. Subsea Control. Typical control system housekeeping check and diagnostic is employed for Na Kika wells with no additional monitoring required for ICV operation. There is a potential for DCV leak and pressurising the ICV function line causing unintended movement of the valve. Na Kika subsea tree has an actuated block valve on the control line which is normally close to prevent this from occurring. Note: GWF-1 DCV has an 'fault' status if the function line pressure goes above 50 bara when the last valve command is CLOSE. This will alert operator of any pressure build-up and will take considerable about of time to pressurize the whole function line due to ICV depth. It also more likely to OPEN than CLOSE an ICV due to working volume on the CLOSE function line. Well Shut-In. There is no automated action on the ICVs when a well is shut-in. There is procedural action on the ICV's when a well is shut-in (note that cross-flow is generally not an issue). PT/RE to advise max allowable time to keep ICV open during well shut-in and consider adding 'alarm' to notify operator. Managing Cross Flow. One Na Kika well is predicted to have cross-flow in the foreseeable future. It is expected that the philosophy will be to shut-in one (of two) zones to prevent cross flow. It is strongly recommended that the closure of ICVs is not linked to the emergency shutdown logic. Incorporate industry experience into GWF-1 Cross Flow Management File Note. Well Intervention. Failure of ICV doesn't necessarily mean complete loss of the well as you can continue with commingle flow (no mean for isolation) or conduct the necessary intervention. However, failure of ICV's will result in continual cross flow between zones and there erode reserves recoverable. ICV intervention methods include a. Coil tubing (Preferred method), b. Wireline tool c. Tractor / Stroker tool. Primary shifting method via coiled tubing which engage custom shifting profile that is machined onto Carbide Carrier. Testing of well intervention tools that may be utilised throughout field life through the ICV configuration is often overlooked. Review well intervention philosophy associated with failed ICV and determine appropriate interface test with intervention tools that should be included in the SIT. Hydrocarbon Ingress into Hydraulics. It is possible for hydrocarbons to ingress into the hydraulic control line via the static seals on the sleeve. This could cause precipitates in the control line, which could potentially sink/amalgamate and cause blockages in the control line. BP subsea XT has remotely actuated hydraulic block valve which stop HC from flowing into the control module. Having a dedicated hydraulic return line for ICV is recommended and has been adopted by GWF-1 project. Organisation. Operator Training. There was no overview training provided by BP on smart well operation. Operators training only consist of on the job assessment while stepping through the relevant operating procedure. GWF-1 Operator Training Plan will include onshore training which include overview of smart well operation and offshore operating procedure validation. Start-Up Support. The start-up of the Galapagos field (3 wells, including Santa Cruz) was the most successful field start-up for Na Kika executed 10 days ahead of schedule. A team of 15 personnel (days and nights) were offshore for execution. A team of 8 personnel were supporting from the onshore ACE, ranging from Production Technologists, Reservoir Engineers, Process Engineers and Operators. A group of similar size and discipline were stationed at the heliport in New Orleans ready for immediate mobilisation in the case of technical/operational issues. Note that the GWA facility does not have ACE faciliaites (can be controlled remotely from the Karratha Gas Plant - reserved for cyclone/emergency situations only), however the facility engineering team have access to view the HMI graphics from the Perth office. Review robustness of current manning for well start-up activities. Consider identifying key personnel of various disciplines to be designated as 'support' in the event of technical/operational issues on start-up. Production support. Any adjustments to ICV position will be at the advice of the Asset Production Technologist/ Production Engineer. Technical Support. Subsea Operation group (control) provide front-end support to offshore operation. Scope includes troubleshooting and organizing subsea intervention. Well intervention sits with D&C group.","id":"T_EFC74598F685EE2131E40D37ABEE06F9","title":"PM #8774433 v4 GWF 1 BP SMART Well Houston Visit Report : 5. observations and learnings","document":"http://10.118.84.17:8080/instance/mel002/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_EFC74598F685EE2131E40D37ABEE06F9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"corpusName":"PB","drimsNumber":"8774433","referenceDrimsNumber":"8774434","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_EFC74598F685EE2192625CED1D0DBC00","version":"4","originalfile":"PM-#8774433-v4-GWF-1 - BP SMART Well Houston Visit Report .doc","author":"wopny8","title":"PM #8774433 v4 GWF 1 BP SMART Well Houston Visit Report : 5. observations and learnings","fileName":"PM-#8774433-v4-GWF-1_-_BP_SMART_Well_Houston_Visit_Report_.doc","year":"2013","DOCNO":"EFC74598F685EE2192625CED1D0DBC00","projectName":"GWF1,NWS,Goodwyn","canonical":"GWF1"}},{"value":"0.030776968225836754","text":"Without methanol injection, these wells could not be kept on production.
