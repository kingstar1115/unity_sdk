    the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish
    Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote
    the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
    Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
    America.\n\n<size=17><b>Article. I.</b></size>\n\n<b>Section. 1.</b>\n\nAll legislative
    Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
    shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n<b>Section. 2.</b>\n\nThe
    House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year
    by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have
    the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State
    Legislature.\n\nNo Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained
    to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United
    States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which
    he shall be chosen.\n\nRepresentatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among
    the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their
    respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of
    free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding
    Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall
    be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United
    States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they
    shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every
    thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until
    such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to
    chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one,
    Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware
    one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and
    Georgia three.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the Representation from any State,
    the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.\n\nThe
    House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall
    have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n\n<b>Section. 3.</b>\n\nThe Senate of the
    United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the
    Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.\n\nImmediately
    after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall
    be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators
    of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the
    second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the
    Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year;
    and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the
    Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments
    until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.\n\nNo
    Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years,
    and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected,
    be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.\n\nThe Vice President
    of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote,
    unless they be equally divided.\n\nThe Senate shall chuse their other Officers,
    and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when
    he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.\n\nThe Senate
    shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose,
    they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States
    is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without
    the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\n\nJudgment in Cases of
    Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification
    to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States:
    but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment,
    Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.\n\n<b>Section. 4.</b>\n\nThe
    Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,
    shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress
    may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places
    of chusing Senators.\n\nThe Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year,
    and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by
    Law appoint a different Day.\n\n<b>Section. 5.</b>\n\nEach House shall be the
    Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority
    of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn
    from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members,
    in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.\n\nEach House
    may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly
    Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\nEach House
    shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same,
    excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and
    Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one
    fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.\n\nNeither House, during the
    Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more
    than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall
    be sitting.\n\n<b>Section. 6.</b>\n\nThe Senators and Representatives shall receive
    a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the
    Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony
    and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at
    the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the
    same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned
    in any other Place.\n\nNo Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for
    which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of
    the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall
    have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the
    United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.\n\n<b>Section.
    7.</b>\n\nAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;
    but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\n\nEvery
    Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall,
    before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If
    he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections
    to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections
    at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration
    two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together
    with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered,
    and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all
    such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and
    the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the
    Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President
    within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him,
    the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress
    by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\n\nEvery
    Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of
    Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be
    presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take
    Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed
    by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules
    and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.\n\n<b>Section. 8.</b>\n\nThe
    Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,
    to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the
    United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout
    the United States;\n\nTo borrow Money on the credit of the United States;\n\nTo

    and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against
    the Law of Nations;\n\nTo declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and
    make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n\nTo raise and support Armies,
    but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two
    Years;\n\nTo provide and maintain a Navy;\n\nTo make Rules for the Government
    and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;\n\nTo provide for calling forth the
    Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;\n\nTo
    provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing
    such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving
    to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority
    of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;\n\nTo
    exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not
    exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance
    of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise
    like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of
    the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals,
    dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;\u2014And\n\nTo make all Laws which shall
    be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and
    all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States,
    or in any Department or Officer thereof.\n\n<b>Section. 9.</b>\n\nThe Migration
    or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper
    to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand
    eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation,
    not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.\n\nThe Privilege of the Writ of Habeas
    Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the
    public Safety may require it.\n\nNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall
    be passed.\n\nNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion
    to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\n\nNo Tax or

    but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and
    Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published
    from time to time.\n\nNo Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States:
    And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without
    the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title,
    of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\n\n<b>Section.
    10.</b>\n\nNo State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant
